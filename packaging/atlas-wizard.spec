%description
AtlasOS Setup runs the first time AtlasOS starts: it asks for the language,
keyboard, network, time zone and the first user, then hands over to the
desktop. Started again at the first login, it offers a fingerprint and a PIN.

%prep
%autosetup -n atlas-wizard-%{version}

%build
# NETWORK: cargo (Corrosion runs it with --locked) fetches crates.io and the
# pinned atlas-framework crates during %%build. That works in podman and with `rpmbuild`
# on a networked machine, not in an offline mock/Koji build.
# CARGO_HOME from the environment keeps a crate cache between builds
# (CLAUDE.md mounts one); otherwise a fresh one in the build dir.
export CARGO_HOME=${CARGO_HOME:-%{_builddir}/cargo-home}
# Fedora's Rust flags (hardening, build-id, ...), also used by Corrosion's cargo.
# The remaps keep build paths (panic locations, assert file names) out of the
# package, as atlas-framework's DESIGN.md asks of apps using its crates.
# HOST_CXXFLAGS reaches only the C++ that cargo's build scripts compile
# (cc-rs reads HOST_ when not cross-compiling; CMake ignores it), which
# otherwise gets no flags from here. (cc-rs then ignores a plain CXXFLAGS,
# which is only for CMake.)
# CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are Fedora's plus the same remap for the C++ CMake
# builds (%%cmake keeps them when set). Without it the build dir, a random
# mktemp one, goes into the debug info and so into the linker's build ID,
# and two builds of one commit differ. These flags split on spaces, so
# _topdir must have none (build-rpm.sh's hasn't).
